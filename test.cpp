Certainly! Let's break down the main.cpp file again, focusing on its structure and functionality:

Include Statements:

The file includes several header files (enemyStats.h, combatsystem.h, inventorysystem.h, and playerStats.h) which likely contain class definitions and function declarations necessary for the game.
Temporary Battle Function (battle()):

This function simulates a battle encounter in the game. It displays a message indicating that the player encounters an enemy and randomly determines whether the player wins or loses the battle.
Main Function (main()):

The main function begins with a welcoming message to the player, introducing them to the adventure game.
It prompts the player to enter their character's name and choose a battle class for their character (warrior, ranger, sorcerer, or rogue). The player's stats are initialized based on their chosen class.
An inventory system is created for the player, and a variable bagAttempts is initialized to 3.
The main game loop starts, presenting the player with a series of options to interact with their environment, such as checking walls, checking doors, or quitting the game.
Based on the player's choice, different scenarios unfold, including finding items, solving puzzles, making decisions, and engaging in battles.
The player's interactions are handled through a switch statement, directing the flow of the game based on the player's input.
The game loop continues until the player decides to quit or reaches the end of the game.
Throughout the game, the player can manage their inventory, make choices that impact their progress, and engage in battles with various enemies encountered in the game world.
At specific points, the player may have the option to interact with a traveling merchant to purchase items using in-game currency (coins).
The game concludes when the player defeats the final boss (the warden) or chooses to quit the game.
Overall, the main() function serves as the central control structure for the game, orchestrating the player's journey through the game world, managing their interactions, and advancing the storyline based on their decisions.
